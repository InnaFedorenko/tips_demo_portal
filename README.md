### Summary
Being a web developer means being part of a community. You‚Äôll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Your task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don‚Äôt use the latest technologies.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio 
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio 
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted 
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN the browser URL changes and I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time 
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default 
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them 
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer‚Äôs applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories 
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message  
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required  
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address 
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer‚Äôs proficiencies
